# Code
Code for the different experiments. Most of the code is duplicated with minor changes between experiments.

| Baseline     | Baseline experiment with no alterations                                                                                     |
| Alt_phases   | Experiment with alternative phases. This code was used for both the expert mapping and the random mapping.                  |
| Phases       | Experiment that looked at connections between phases. This code was used for both lateral connections and full connections. |
| Techniques   | This code was used for the alternative technique mapping for events to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework                       |
| Intermediate | Experiment that allowed direct connections between nodes even when intermediate nodes were found.                           |
